partlist.php

- The code first determines whether the PC spec is High, Mid or Low
- and if the user plans to overclock the CPU.
- The queries then fetch the parts from the database depending on the users chosen input.
- The parts are then echoed into a table
- A final bit of JavaScript adds up the totals of all the parts to give the user a total cost
